  "body": "### Abstract.\r\nWe describe the way to get benefit from broad cultural trends through the quantitative analysis of a vast digital\r\nbook collection representing the digested history of humanity. Our research work has revealed that appropriately comparing the occurrence patterns of words in some periods of human literature can help us to accurately determine the\r\nsemantic similarity between these words by means of computers without requiring human intervention. Preliminary results seem to be promising.\r\n\r\n### Conclusions\r\nWe have described how we have perform a quantitative analysis of a vast digital book collection representing a significant sample of the history of literature to solve problems related to the semantic similarity. In fact, we have shown that appropriately choosing a combination of quantitative algorithms for comparing time series representing the occurrence patterns, some statistical transformations on source data which can help to reduce noise, and the election of a correct time window can provide very accurate results when measuring semantic similarity between single words.\r\n\r\n### Related Work\r\n1.
